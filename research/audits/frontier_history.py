"""Reconstruct the board's (n, k, d) Pareto frontier from git history.

The board ranks codes on (n, k, d, w). `d` is a witness-backed *upper* bound
whose history is full of downward revisions (``[[882,18,30]]`` -> 29,
``[[684,12,81]]`` -> 66), which is a reason to watch it, not to drop it: with
`d` removed the (n, k) frontier is won by rate alone (``[[n, n-2, 2]]`` exists
for every even n), and what that frontier then measures is who submitted the
highest-rate low-distance code. So this script keeps `d`, reports the
three-axis frontier (n lower, k and d higher are better) after every landing
that moved it, and makes the revisions visible as the steps *down*.

It replays ``codes/*.json`` along main's first-parent chain -- one step per
landing on the board -- and reports, after every step that moved the board,
the CSS code count, the frontier's size, and the frontier's dominated
hypervolume. The replay is only worth quoting if it ends where the repository
is, so ``research/audits/test_frontier_history.py`` asserts exactly that: the
final state must equal ``git ls-tree -r HEAD -- codes/`` read as (n, k, d),
CSS only. Plain ``git log`` breaks that (it orders by date, so a deletion can
land before the add it deletes), and a rename reported for a rewrite of an
unrelated file breaks it differently unless the destination is re-read.

Two charts, both dependency-free SVG:

``--plot`` draws the frontier as a shape: one panel per distance floor
(d >= 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24), each carrying the (n, k) staircase of the codes
that clear the floor, on log axes, as of a few snapshots (one per month by
default). The region gained between consecutive snapshots is shaded in the
newer snapshot's colour and a region lost (a correction or removal) in red,
and today's staircase carries a dot and an ``n,k,d`` label per code.

``--plot-history`` draws one line on a time axis: the frontier's hypervolume
as a share of today's, with every downward step marked and named. That is the
signal a "codes over time" count hides.

``--frames`` writes the panel chart once per snapshot (one per day by
default), each frame over the previous one in grey, and ``--gif`` assembles
those frames into an animation. The charts are stdlib only; the GIF needs
``rsvg-convert`` on PATH and Pillow (the ``research`` extra).

  uv run --frozen python research/audits/frontier_history.py
  uv run --frozen python research/audits/frontier_history.py --out /tmp/frontier.csv

  uv run --frozen python research/audits/frontier_history.py --plot-history history.svg
  uv run --frozen --extra research python research/audits/frontier_history.py --gif frontier.gif

Hypervolume is taken in log2 coordinates against the reference point
(n = ``--n-ref``, k = 1/2, d = 1/2): a frontier code contributes the box
``log2(n_ref/n) x (1 + log2 k) x (1 + log2 d)``, and the union of those boxes
is the number. Log space is what the board's own ``kd^2/n`` lives in, and the
half-unit reference keeps ``k = 1`` codes (which sit on the small-n frontier
legitimately) from contributing nothing. A code at or above ``n_ref``
contributes nothing.

Only the main (CSS) board is replayed; general stabilizer codes rank on their
own board and are skipped. n, k and d are read per file *version*, so an
in-place correction is seen; a rename is read at its destination.
