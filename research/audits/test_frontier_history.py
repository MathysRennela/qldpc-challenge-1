"""Tests for the frontier replay (``frontier_history.py``).

The script exists so that other people can quote its numbers, and its numbers
are only as good as its replay of ``codes/``, so the invariant that matters is
stated once and asserted directly: whatever walk ``replay()`` takes through
history, it must end where the repository is. The final state is compared to
``git ls-tree -r HEAD -- codes/`` read as ``(n, k, d)`` triples, CSS only --
three seconds of git, and the exact check that would have caught a replay that
applies commits in an order the ancestry never had.

The rest pins what is wrong silently if it regresses: a rename is read at its
destination (git reports a rewrite of an unrelated file as a rename when the
similarity check matches, so carrying the source's value over invents one no
blob has); the three-axis frontier is a strict antichain; the hypervolume is
the union volume, not the sum; a landing is dated by when it landed; and the
region between two staircases is split into gains and losses correctly.
