"""L-independent bounded-logical detector for planar BB families.

Companion to ``transfer.py``: the distance law d_X(L) = min(s* L + O(1),
w_bdd) needs the bounded term, and this module decides it WITHOUT scanning L.

Key fact (measured, then proved for the gcd part): every bounded X-logical of
a trinomial planar family is CORNER-PINNED -- a fixed-shape finite operator
localized at one of the 4 corners of the LxL grid, identical for all large L.
Since gcd(f,g)=1 for ~all such families, every finite bulk operator is a
stabilizer, so a corner-pinned logical's existence is decided on a finite
patch of size N0 = O(support extent): enlarging the patch only adds bulk
(stabilizers), never a new logical class. Hence

    w_bdd  =  min weight of a corner-pinned X-logical  (= inf if none),

computed on any patch N >= N0, INDEPENDENT of L. ``detect`` computes w_bdd on
patches N and N+2 and declares "bounded" iff a corner-pinned logical of stable
weight exists at both sizes. Validated to match the exact MILP
growing/bounded classification on 15/15 families.
