"""Open-boundary planar BB codes, the fast greedy builder + exact MILP distance.

Construction of Liang-Eberhardt-Chen "Planar quantum LDPC codes with open
boundaries" (arXiv:2504.08887, Sec. II / Table V): a torus bivariate-bicycle
code with polynomials f, g is truncated to an open Lx x Ly grid with
directional anyon condensation -- X-type boundary terms (truncated bulk
X-stabilizers) may hang off the top/bottom edges (m-condensed), Z-type off the
left/right edges (e-condensed), and corner anticommutation is resolved by a
greedy drop of the conflicting X rows (the paper's footnote-6 convention).

These codes are 2D-LOCAL: qubits A(i,j)/B(i,j) live on a bilayer grid, every
check acts within a fixed radius. ``grid_coordinates`` produces the layout for
``submit.make_submission(coordinates=..., layers=2)`` so the verifier can
compute the ``2d-local-*`` track membership.

VALIDATED (against the paper, MILP-exact): the flagship [[288,8,12]] family
(f = x + x^2 + y^2, g = 1 + x^2 y + x^2 y^2) gives k = 8 for L = 6..12 square
AND rectangular, d = 4 (6x6), 6 (8x8), 9 (10x10), matching Table V.

SCOPE / LIMITS (measured, read before reusing):

* GENERIC (f,g) WARNING: for arbitrary exponents the directional truncation +
  greedy corner drop does NOT restore the topological-order condition (sampled:
  only ~13/60 of MV==8 candidates come out with the right k; the rest inflate k
  with weight-1/2 local logicals). This builder is validated for the
  [[288,8,12]] family; for other (f,g) treat its output as "a CSS code", not
  "the paper's planar code" -- screen with a k(L)-stability check across two
  sizes, or use the exact gauge engine in ``boundary_engine.build_planar``.
* Weight-6 families only, where boundary gauge operators ARE truncated bulk
  stabilizers. Weight-8 families need the secondary (non-truncation) boundary
  generators that only ``boundary_engine`` produces.
* Keeps all 2*Lx*Ly qubits; the qubit-removal layouts (e.g. [[188,8,9]]) come
  out of ``boundary_engine.build_planar``'s cleanup automatically.

The distance functions need scipy (the ``research`` extra); construction and
the coordinate helper stay numpy-only.
