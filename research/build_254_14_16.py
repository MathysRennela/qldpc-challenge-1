"""Rebuild the [[254,14,16]] generalized-bicycle candidate from its parameters.

Code: two-block generalized bicycle (arXiv:2111.03654 / arXiv:2306.16400)
over the cyclic group Z_127, H_X = [A | B], H_Z = [B^T | A^T], with the
trinomial supports recorded below. These are the supports recovered from the
staged matrix (the two-block form is ambiguous under the shift-direction
convention; the string in the earlier draft was the negated/other variant and
does not rebuild — see notes/254-14-16.md).

Run:  uv run python research/build_254_14_16.py
Writes: research/candidates/254-14-16-rebuilt.json (gitignored staging).
