"""Confirm a candidate's distance beyond the screening upper bound -- by reusing
the repo's existing server-side certifiers on a code you are still building,
without hand-writing a submission first.

The screening number from ``surrogate.distance_rand`` is an upper bound. Before
you claim a distance, confirm it. Two independent confirmations, both built on
tools the repo already ships:

* ``exact_distance``  -> ``verify/certify.py`` (scipy/HiGHS MILP, the ``d=``
  tier): proves no lighter nontrivial logical exists, per side. Needs **scipy**.
* ``decoder_distance`` -> ``decode/distance.py`` (BP+OSD residual witnesses): an
  independent upper-bound mechanism (a decoder's mistakes, not linear algebra);
  agreement with the surrogate strengthens corroboration. Needs **ldpc**.

These dependencies are optional (see the ``research`` extra in pyproject.toml).
If one is missing, the call raises a clear ImportError telling you how to get it
(e.g. ``uv run --with ldpc python ...``). Both take raw ``(HX, HZ)`` and build
the throwaway submission doc the certifiers consume via ``submit.make_submission``.
