"""Tests for `qldpc targets` (issue #639).

The command exists to tell a newcomer where to aim, so the property that
matters is that its numbers are the board's own. It reads the same cells() and
pareto() the site uses to award record stars; if it ever disagrees with them,
it is worse than not existing, because it would send people at cells that are
not actually open.
